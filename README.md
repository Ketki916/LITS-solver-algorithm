# LITS-solver-algorithm

This algorithm solves the puzzle LITS (https://www.puzzle-lits.com/). The inputs are a rowMatrix (a list of lists containing each row of the puzzle, and each row contains the individual squares grouped into lists which represent their block) and a columnMatrix (similar structure as the row matrix except it represents each column of the puzzle). Unfilled squares are represented by the string "unfilled", filled squares are represented by the string "filled", and squares that cannot be filled are labeled with "x" as the algorithm is implemented.

The output is the finished rowMatrix which contains all the filled squares in the solution.

Three example puzzles are included at the beginning of the algorithm with the puzzle code in comments to find it in the website.
